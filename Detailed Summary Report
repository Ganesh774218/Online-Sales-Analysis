Data Manipulation/Cleaning
Tools used - Python
Library - Pandas
Software - JupyterLab
Procedure - 
Library Imports & Setup:
-By importing key data analysis libraries—pandas and numpy for data manipulation, matplotlib and seaborn for visualization, and suppressed warnings to maintain a clean output environment.

Loading the Dataset - 
- The raw sales data (New_online_sales.csv) was loaded into a pandas DataFrame, setting the foundation for subsequent data wrangling, exploration, and cleaning.

Data Exploration - 
- Inspected the dataset's structure with .info() to understand its columns, data types, and non-null counts.
-Following that used .isnull().sum() to tally missing values in each column and reviewed sample records with .tail().

Data Cleaning:
- Addressed data quality by:
- Dropped rows with missing (null) values using .dropna(inplace=True).
- Double-checked for remaining nulls to verify that the dataset was fully cleaned.
- Explicitly checked for missing CustomerID values, ensuring data integrity.

 Data Type & Date Conversion:
- Observed column data types with .dtypes, and performed robust date handling by:
- Converted the InvoiceDate column from string to datetime format (with day-first interpretation), handling parsing errors via coercion.
- Extracted just the date portion for simplified analysis.

 Dropping Unneeded Columns:
- The column DateTime was removed as it was redundant, streamlining the dataset for analysis.

 Saving Cleaned Data:
- Exported the cleaned DataFrame to new CSV files at specified locations—once locally (New_online_sales) and once to a user directory for seamless integration into further tools or databases.

 Save Verification:
 A check confirmed that the cleaned file was successfully saved in the designated directory, completing the data preparation for Mysql workbench.
